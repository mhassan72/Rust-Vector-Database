## Technical Debt and Known Issues

### Current Limitations
1. **RocksDB Dependency**: Temporarily disabled due to macOS compilation issues
   - Need to resolve snappy compression build errors
   - Consider alternative storage backends for development
   
2. **Module Stubs**: Many modules are commented out pending implementation
   - Storage layer modules (wal, hot_tier, cold_tier, etc.)
   - Index modules (hnsw, ivf_pq, etc.)
   - API modules (grpc, rest, etc.)

3. **Placeholder Implementations**: API methods return `todo!()` macros
   - PhenixDBAPI trait methods need actual implementation
   - Binary executables have minimal functionality

### Code Quality Issues
1. **Compiler Warnings**: 
   - Unused variables in transaction coordinator
   - Unused mutable variables in edge builder
   - Unused imports in CLI binary

2. **Test Coverage**: 
   - Need integration tests for cross-module functionality
   - Performance benchmarks need real workload scenarios
   - Error handling paths need more comprehensive testing
